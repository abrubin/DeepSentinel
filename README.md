# DeepSentinel

The goal of this repository is to give tools to use Deep Learning on Sentinel-2 satellite images.

A blog post has been written about the context (to be published soon).

This repository shows:

- How to download Sentinel-2 images using Google Earth Engine Python API.
- How to get a new SOTA (july 2019) on [EuroSAT dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00029) using multispectral images. The model has a 0.99 accuracy (previous SOTA: 0.9857 => 30% less error rate).
- How to use the model pretrained on EuroSAT for you own classification tasks.
- How to process and visualize multispectral images.
